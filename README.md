the people in the roblox area have such beautiful and amazing styles sobs

please tell me if my style looks similar to yours, im trying to expand my style more and i dont want to accidentally copy someone else's style

just so you know, i do NOT tint(deadass i dont know how) its my own style. and i don't have a consistent style, i change my styles a lot because of that! ^_^

waszzup !!! originally wanted github to claim my user. (that i always use) mainly using this for ponytown.  im on the game alot!

multi-fandom dude

im friendly, mainly friendly.
so feel free to talk to me. (would appreciate it greatly! im really bored on PT and im trying my best to socialize.)

ask me any questions regarding more info.

[IMPORTANTLY]: inspiration is a-okay. just dont copy my shit pixel for pixel or post w/o permission(even though i wont agree either way)

MY GITHUB IS SO EMPTY
