originally wanted github to claim my user. (that i always use) mainly using this for ponytown. my ass learned how to put images now !!!!

im on the game alot!

multi-fandom dude (in my spongebob phase atm lol)

c+h or int is always welcome, do not hesitate!! im not rude, just socially anxious.

im friendly, mainly friendly.
so feel free to talk to me. (would appreciate it greatly! im really bored on PT and im trying my best to socialize.)

ask me any questions regarding more info.

[IMPORTANTLY]: Do NOT copy me or take any inspiration, please. im trying to experiment and i would very much appreciate if you don't copy or take any inspiration./lh

just so you know, i do NOT tint. its my own style. and i don't have a consistent style, i change my styles alot! ^_^

i honestly go afk alot in-game, unless im with a friend. so whisper me to talk whenever i am!!! (ps; i can be AFK for a pretty long time!^^)

and i try to not be AFK all the time aswell.

ps; when interacting with me, PLEASE do not make your first impression weird. im weird myself, but weird to an extent. so i beg to differ, dont be too weird, i get pretty uncomfortable easily!!! ill eventually get comfortable with you if we know eachother long enough though <3
