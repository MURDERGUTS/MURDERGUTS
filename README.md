hey... man's. im new to github :3

wanted github to claim my user. mainly using this for ponytown. not gonna put actual work into it i guess </3

im on the game alot.

please. homestuckies. dni, ive got pretty bad experiences from yous, i dont mean any offense!!

multi-fandom dude

c+h or int is always welcome. can be considered as a cuddle buddy atp lol

im friendly, mainly friendly.
so feel free to talk to me. (would appreciate it greatly! im really bored on PT and im trying my best to socialize.)

ask me any questions regarding more info.

-☆ inspiration is fine, just have to ask me first please! ♡

just so you know, i do NOT tint. its my own style. and i don't have a consistent style, i change my styles alot! ^_^

i honestly go afk alot in-game, unless im with a friend. so whisper me to talk whenever i am!!! (ps; i can be AFK for a pretty long time!^^)

and i try to not be AFK all the time aswell.

ps; when interacting with me, PLEASE do not make your first impression weird. im weird myself, but weird to an extent. so i beg to differ, dont be too weird, i get pretty uncomfortable easily!!! ill eventually get comfortable with you if we know eachother long enough though <3
